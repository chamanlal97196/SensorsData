# SensorsData


Most Android-powered devices have built-in sensors that measure motion, orientation, and various environmental conditions. 
These sensors are capable of providing raw data with high precision and accuracy, and are useful if you want to monitor 
three-dimensional device movement or positioning, or you want to monitor changes in the ambient environment near a device.
For example, a game might track readings from a device's gravity sensor to infer complex user gestures and motions, 
such as tilt, shake, rotation, or swing. Likewise, a weather application might use a device's temperature sensor and 
humidity sensor to calculate and report the dewpoint, or a travel application might use the geomagnetic field sensor 
and accelerometer to report a compass bearing.
